<h2>ChapStick</h2>

<p>An ad campaign for ChapStick aimed toward young women in their early twenties not so interested in having the sexiest lips, but wanting to have nice, non-chapped lips. The Ad Campaign was composed of three print components, an online component and an environmental component.</p>

<p>A mock up of an environmental poster displayed at a mall where the ads would be visible to the public and peak interest.</p>

<p>The campaign was focused on showing the efficiency of ChapStick and its ways of healing the chappiest of lips.</p>

<p>An online component was needed to convey the message of the campaign on the internet, but have more of an interactive part to  give more of an interest.</p>
